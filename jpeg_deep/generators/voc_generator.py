        Arguments:
            images_dirs (list): A list of strings, where each string is the path of a directory that
                contains images that are to be part of the dataset. This allows you to aggregate multiple datasets
                into one (e.g. one directory that contains the images for Pascal VOC 2007, another that contains
                the images for Pascal VOC 2012, etc.).
            image_set_filenames (list): A list of strings, where each string is the path of the text file with the image
                set to be loaded. Must be one file per image directory given. These text files define what images in the
                respective image directories are to be part of the dataset and simply contains one image ID per line
                and nothing else.
            annotations_dirs (list, optional): A list of strings, where each string is the path of a directory that
                contains the annotations (XML files) that belong to the images in the respective image directories given.
                The directories must contain one XML file per image and the name of an XML file must be the image ID
                of the image it belongs to. The content of the XML files must be in the Pascal VOC format.
            classes (list, optional): A list containing the names of the object classes as found in the
                `name` XML tags. Must include the class `background` as the first list item. The order of this list
                defines the class IDs.
            include_classes (list, optional): Either 'all' or a list of integers containing the class IDs that
                are to be included in the dataset. If 'all', all ground truth boxes will be included in the dataset.
            exclude_truncated (bool, optional): If `True`, excludes boxes that are labeled as 'truncated'.
            exclude_difficult (bool, optional): If `True`, excludes boxes that are labeled as 'difficult'.
            ret (bool, optional): Whether or not to return the outputs of the parser.
            verbose (bool, optional): If `True`, prints out the progress for operations that may take a bit longer.

            None by default, optionally lists for whichever are available of images, image filenames, labels, image IDs,

        Converts the currently loaded dataset into a HDF5 file. This HDF5 file contains all
        images as uncompressed arrays in a contiguous block of memory, which allows for them
        to be loaded faster. Such an uncompressed dataset, however, may take up considerably
        more space on your hard drive than the sum of the source images in a compressed format
        such as JPG or PNG.

        It is recommended that you always convert the dataset into an HDF5 dataset if you
        have enugh hard drive space since loading from an HDF5 dataset accelerates the data
        generation noticeably.

        Note that you must load a dataset (e.g. via one of the parser methods) before creating
        an HDF5 dataset from it.

        The created HDF5 dataset will remain open upon its creation so that it can be used right
        away.

        Arguments:
            file_path (str, optional): The full file path under which to store the HDF5 dataset.
                You can load this output file via the `DataGenerator` constructor in the future.
            resize (tuple, optional): `False` or a 2-tuple `(height, width)` that represents the
                target size for the images. All images in the dataset will be resized to this
                target size before they will be written to the HDF5 file. If `False`, no resizing
                will be performed.
            variable_image_size (bool, optional): The only purpose of this argument is that its
                value will be stored in the HDF5 dataset in order to be able to quickly find out
                whether the images in the dataset all have the same size or not.

        Generates batches of samples and (optionally) corresponding labels indefinitely.

        Can shuffle the samples consistently after each complete pass.

        Optionally takes a list of arbitrary image transformations to apply to the
        samples ad hoc.

        Arguments:
            batch_size (int, optional): The size of the batches to be generated.
            shuffle (bool, optional): Whether or not to shuffle the dataset before each pass.
                This option should always be `True` during training, but it can be useful to turn shuffling off
                for debugging or if you're using the generator for prediction.
            transformations (list, optional): A list of transformations that will be applied to the images and labels
                in the given order. Each transformation is a callable that takes as input an image (as a Numpy array)
                and optionally labels (also as a Numpy array) and returns an image and optionally labels in the same
                format.
            label_encoder (callable, optional): Only relevant if labels are given. A callable that takes as input the
                labels of a batch (as a list of Numpy arrays) and returns some structure that represents those labels.
                The general use case for this is to convert labels from their input format to a format that a given object
                detection model needs as its training targets.
            returns (set, optional): A set of strings that determines what outputs the generator yields. The generator's output
                is always a tuple that contains the outputs specified in this set and only those. If an output is not available,
                it will be `None`. The output tuple can contain the following outputs according to the specified keyword strings:
                * 'processed_images': An array containing the processed images. Will always be in the outputs, so it doesn't
                    matter whether or not you include this keyword in the set.
                * 'encoded_labels': The encoded labels tensor. Will always be in the outputs if a label encoder is given,
                    so it doesn't matter whether or not you include this keyword in the set if you pass a label encoder.
                * 'matched_anchors': Only available if `labels_encoder` is an `SSDInputEncoder` object. The same as 'encoded_labels',
                    but containing anchor box coordinates for all matched anchor boxes instead of ground truth coordinates.
                    This can be useful to visualize what anchor boxes are being matched to each ground truth box. Only available
                    in training mode.
                * 'processed_labels': The processed, but not yet encoded labels. This is a list that contains for each
                    batch image a Numpy array with all ground truth boxes for that image. Only available if ground truth is available.
                * 'filenames': A list containing the file names (full paths) of the images in the batch.
                * 'image_ids': A list containing the integer IDs of the images in the batch. Only available if there
                    are image IDs available.
                * 'evaluation-neutral': A nested list of lists of booleans. Each list contains `True` or `False` for every ground truth
                    bounding box of the respective image depending on whether that bounding box is supposed to be evaluation-neutral (`True`)
                    or not (`False`). May return `None` if there exists no such concept for a given dataset. An example for
                    evaluation-neutrality are the ground truth boxes annotated as "difficult" in the Pascal VOC datasets, which are
                    usually treated to be neutral in a model evaluation.
                * 'inverse_transform': A nested list that contains a list of "inverter" functions for each item in the batch.
                    These inverter functions take (predicted) labels for an image as input and apply the inverse of the transformations
                    that were applied to the original image to them. This makes it possible to let the model make predictions on a
                    transformed image and then convert these predictions back to the original image. This is mostly relevant for
                    evaluation: If you want to evaluate your model on a dataset with varying image sizes, then you are forced to
                    transform the images somehow (e.g. by resizing or cropping) to make them all the same size. Your model will then
                    predict boxes for those transformed images, but for the evaluation you will need predictions with respect to the
                    original images, not with respect to the transformed images. This means you will have to transform the predicted
                    box coordinates back to the original image sizes. Note that for each image, the inverter functions for that
                    image need to be applied in the order in which they are given in the respective list for that image.
                * 'original_images': A list containing the original images in the batch before any processing.
                * 'original_labels': A list containing the original ground truth boxes for the images in this batch before any
                    processing. Only available if ground truth is available.
                The order of the outputs in the tuple is the order of the list above. If `returns` contains a keyword for an
                output that is unavailable, that output omitted in the yielded tuples and a warning will be raised.
            keep_images_without_gt (bool, optional): If `False`, images for which there aren't any ground truth boxes before
                any transformations have been applied will be removed from the batch. If `True`, such images will be kept
                in the batch.
            degenerate_box_handling (str, optional): How to handle degenerate boxes, which are boxes that have `xmax <= xmin` and/or
                `ymax <= ymin`. Degenerate boxes can sometimes be in the dataset, or non-degenerate boxes can become degenerate
                after they were processed by transformations. Note that the generator checks for degenerate boxes after all
                transformations have been applied (if any), but before the labels were passed to the `label_encoder` (if one was given).
                Can be one of 'warn' or 'remove'. If 'warn', the generator will merely print a warning to let you know that there
                are degenerate boxes in a batch. If 'remove', the generator will remove degenerate boxes from the batch silently.

        Yields:
            The next batch as a tuple of items as defined by the `returns` argument.
